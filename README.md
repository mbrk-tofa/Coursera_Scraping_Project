# Coursera_Scraping_Project

Problem Scenario
A recruitment agency is looking to improve its job vacancy sourcing. They want you to use web scraping tools to extract job posting data from multiple sites. Your analysis will help the agency provide its clients with relevant job openings more quickly, giving them a competitive advantage over other job applicants.

Solution Approach:
The solution approach uses open-source API to scrape the data. The approach will ensure cleaned and relevant data is generated through legal means.
Below are the steps followed:
1. Setting up the Jupyter environment on my VS Code editor using Python 3.11.3 kernel
2. I then prepare the code to send the request using the API link ( https://remoteok.com/api  )
3. I then used Python list structure to collect the scraped data using  for-loop,
4. Then save collected data using Pandas data frame structure
5. I then apply various data preprocessing tools to check for inconsistencies and address them accordingly. 

Impact of the Solution:
- The quality of data that my solution produces and the data component fields it contains will greatly help in achieving the state project objectives.
- The scraping and preprocessing tools are set to retrieve data on a timely basis, thereby updating the current one. This will enable the agency to   receive constant updates on the data it uses to manage its business processes, thereby enabling it to achieve the stated objectives.
